## write-up

Just be patient and read the assembly like me XD

Or maybe you can try pintools to solve it, but it is not practical

It has many checks

After failing the beginning check, the rest of instruction will not be execute

We can use pintools to brute force the character and count the insturctions, since there is only 11 characters

But some check needs multiple characters to be right at the same time to pass the check, it's not practical to solve it by pintools
