**points** : 438

**solves** : 76

## write-up

Just be patient and read the assembly like me XD

Or you can use pintools to solve it as well

Because it has many checks

After failing the beginning check, the rest of instruction will not be execute

We can use pintools to brute force the character and count the insturctions, since there is only 11 characters
