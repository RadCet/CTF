# noxCTF 2018 : WTF

**category** : crypto

**points** : 742

## write-up

The original text was N = IObA...

I guess it was leet code ( See a lot of leet code in this CTF... )

So actually N = 1064...

Since e is very big, maybe it is wiener attack ( just guessing... )

And it is indeed wiener attack
